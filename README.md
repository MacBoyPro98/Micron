## No Drop Nuts
There are 2 versions of this mod, 1 from [Zruncho](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/zruncho/V0_No_Drop_Nuts) and the other from a user named [Zen3D](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Zen3D/V0_1515_T-nut/). Both of them have their uses. I prefer to use the Zen3D kind just for the fact that the screw can go all the way through the printed part. Zrunchos do have a much nicer fitment into the extrusions but they also dont allow the screw to go all the way through.
